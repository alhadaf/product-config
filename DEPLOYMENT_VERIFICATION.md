# Deployment Verification

This file is used to trigger a new deployment to Vercel.

Last deployment attempt: 2025-09-24

Status: In Progress

## Current Deployment Status
Your Shopify app has been deployed to Vercel at:
https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app/

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your "product-config" project
3. Check the deployment status - it should show as successful
4. Review the deployment logs for any errors

### 2. Test API Endpoints
Try accessing these URLs in your browser:

1. **Root Endpoint**:
   ```
   https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app/
   ```
   Expected: Should show the Shopify app interface

2. **Product Details Endpoint**:
   ```
   https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app/api/products/details?productId=gid://shopify/Product/HANDLE-your-product-handle
   ```
   Replace "your-product-handle" with an actual product handle from your Shopify store.

3. **Product Variants Endpoint**:
   ```
   https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app/api/products/variants?productId=gid://shopify/Product/HANDLE-your-product-handle
   ```
   Replace "your-product-handle" with an actual product handle from your Shopify store.

### 3. Update Shopify App Configuration
1. Go to your Shopify Partner Dashboard
2. Select your "Product Configurator" app
3. Go to "App setup"
4. Update the following fields:

   **App URL**:
   ```
   https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app
   ```

   **Whitelisted redirection URL(s)**:
   ```
   https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app/auth/callback
   https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app/auth/shopify/callback
   https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app/api/auth/callback
   ```

### 4. Test in Shopify Store
1. Install the app in your Shopify store
2. Go to the app interface in your Shopify admin
3. Try creating a new product configuration
4. Verify that the app can access Shopify product data

## Troubleshooting

### If API Endpoints Return 404
1. Check that your deployment completed successfully
2. Verify that the routes exist in your code
3. Check the Vercel logs for errors

### If Shopify Authentication Fails
1. Verify that the App URL and Whitelisted URLs are correctly set
2. Check that the API keys in your environment variables are correct
3. Ensure that the required scopes are included

### If Product Data is Not Loading
1. Verify that your Shopify store has products
2. Check that the product handles in your test URLs are correct
3. Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions to read product data

## Next Steps

Once you've verified that the deployment is working correctly:

1. Test all functionality of the product configurator
2. Make sure the theme integration is working properly
3. Verify that customer designs can be saved and retrieved
4. Test the app in different browsers and devices

If you encounter any issues, check the Vercel logs and Shopify app logs for detailed error messages.
