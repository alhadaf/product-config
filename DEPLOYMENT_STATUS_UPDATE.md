# Shopify App Deployment Status Update

## Current Status
✅ **Vercel Deployment Created**: Your Shopify app has been deployed to Vercel at:
https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app/

✅ **Environment Configuration Fixed**: The main deployment issue has been resolved by:
- Creating a [.env.local](file:///c%3A/Users/alimh/Downloads/Compressed/theme_export__double-exposure-com-double-expo-theme-main__15SEP2025-0629am/product-configurator/.env.local) file with `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` left empty for Vercel deployments
- Modifying [shopify.server.js](file:///c%3A/Users/alimh/Downloads/Compressed/theme_export__double-exposure-com-double-expo-theme-main__15SEP2025-0629am/product-configurator/app/shopify.server.js) to use a fallback URL when the environment variable is not set

✅ **API Routes Updated**: The API routes have been enhanced to:
- Fetch real Shopify data instead of using mock data
- Provide proper fallback mechanisms when Shopify data is not accessible
- Include better error handling and logging

✅ **Vercel Configuration Added**: Created a [vercel.json](file:///c%3A/Users/alimh/Downloads/Compressed/theme_export__double-exposure-com-double-expo-theme-main__15SEP2025-0629am/product-configurator/vercel.json) file to ensure proper routing and build configuration

✅ **Vercel Remix Package Installed**: Successfully installed `@vercel/remix` package to support proper Remix app deployment on Vercel

## Next Steps

### 1. Trigger a New Deployment
Since we've made several changes to the codebase, you'll need to trigger a new deployment on Vercel:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your "product-config" project
3. Trigger a new deployment by either:
   - Pushing a new commit to your GitHub repository
   - Using the "Redeploy" button in the Vercel dashboard

### 2. Update Shopify App Configuration
After the new deployment is complete:
1. Go to your Shopify Partner Dashboard
2. Select your "Product Configurator" app
3. Go to "App setup"
4. Update the following fields:

   **App URL**:
   ```
   https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app
   ```

   **Whitelisted redirection URL(s)**:
   ```
   https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app/auth/callback
   ```

### 3. Test the Deployment
1. Visit your deployment URL: https://product-config-ricpymi53-alhadafs-projects-e7574e40.vercel.app/
2. Check that the page loads without errors
3. Test the API endpoints using the test page at `/test-api.html`

## Troubleshooting

### If You Still See "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" Errors
1. Check the Vercel logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that all environment variables are correctly set in the Vercel dashboard
3. Ensure that the `@vercel/remix` package is properly installed
4. Check that the [vercel.json](file:///c%3A/Users/alimh/Downloads/Compressed/theme_export__double-exposure-com-double-expo-theme-main__15SEP2025-0629am/product-configurator/vercel.json) file is correctly configured

### If API Endpoints Return 404
1. Verify that the routes exist in your code
2. Check that the Vercel build completed successfully
3. Ensure that the [vercel.json](file:///c%3A/Users/alimh/Downloads/Compressed/theme_export__double-exposure-com-double-expo-theme-main__15SEP2025-0629am/product-configurator/vercel.json) routes are correctly configured

### If Shopify Authentication Fails
1. Verify that the App URL and Whitelisted URLs are correctly set in your Shopify Partner Dashboard
2. Check that the API keys in your environment variables are correct
3. Ensure that the required scopes are included in your configuration

## Expected Outcome
After completing these steps, your Shopify app should be properly deployed and functioning on Vercel. The app will:
1. Properly initialize without the "empty appUrl configuration" error
2. Fetch real product data from Shopify when available
3. Gracefully fall back to mock data when Shopify data is not accessible
4. Work correctly with Vercel's dynamic URL generation
